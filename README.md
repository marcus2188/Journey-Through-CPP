# Journey-Through-C++
### In Starter Series, I go through C++ syntax from beginner to intermediate.
### In Applications, I build C++ applications whether console based or GUI based. 

### Starter Series
**basic1.cpp** -> Explains the core basics of a simple helloworld programme in C++ and inits\
**math2.cpp** -> Displays some basic mathematics operators, the modulus and while loop\
**types3.cpp** -> Displays C++ primitive types data, size, and range of values\
**vectorarray4.cpp** -> Introduces vectors contrasting with arrays\
**operators5.cpp** -> Goes over critical boolean and math symbols\
**controlflow6.cpp** -> Highlights iterations, and ternary conditional blocks\
**randomtime7.cpp** -> Introduces random number generators, seeds and timers

### App Series
**pizzashop.cpp** -> Contains a console based pizzashop app made using simple syntax

# Journey-Through-C++
### In Starter Series, I go through C++ syntax from beginner to intermediate.
### In Applications, I build C++ applications whether console based or GUI based. 

### Starter Series
**basic1.cpp** -> Explains the core basics of a simple helloworld programme in C++ and inits\
**math2.cpp** -> Displays some basic mathematics operators, the modulus and while loop\
**types3.cpp** -> Displays C++ primitive types data, size, and range of values\
**vectorarray4.cpp** -> Introduces vectors contrasting with arrays\
**operators5.cpp** -> Goes over critical boolean and math symbols\
**controlflow6.cpp** -> Highlights iterations, and ternary conditional blocks\
**randomtime7.cpp** -> Introduces random number generators, seeds and timers
**namespaceFunctions8.cpp** -> Creating new namespaces and function controllers\
**pointerreferences9.cpp** -> Finally touch on c++ pointer headaches\
**structclass10.cpp** -> Simple inbuilt data structures in C++\
**classOOP11.cpp** -> Introduces powerful OOP concepts in C++ objects\
**fileio12.cpp** -> Opening, closing, reading and writing various file types\
**exceptionmalloc13.cpp** -> Displays error handling, with dynamic memory allocation\
**preprocessorthread14.cpp** -> Deals with C++ preprocessor headers, and threads\
**multithreading15.cpp** -> How to use multithreading in C++ context processes\

### App Series
**pizzashop.cpp** -> Contains a console based pizzashop app made using simple syntax\

### Dockerize -> gcc:latest included
Pizzashop app in App Series is runnable as a dockerized container image at https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dexter1x/pizzashop
